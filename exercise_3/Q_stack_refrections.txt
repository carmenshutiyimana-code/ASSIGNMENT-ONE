Reflection: Why stack can’t replace FIFO in customer lines
LIFO vs FIFO conflict

   - A stack follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).
   - That means the last customer to join would be the first to be served.
   - This is unfair in public services because latecomers skip those who waited longer.

Customer dissatisfaction

  - Imagine a bank or MoMo line where the last person who arrives is served first.
  - The earlier customers would feel cheated, leading to conflict and mistrust.

Breaking fairness principle

  - Government and financial services must follow “first come, first served”.
  - Only a queue (FIFO) can guarantee that fairness.

Right tool for the right problem

   - Stack is great for undo, backtracking, or reversing strings (like your RWANDA example).
   - Queue is the only right choice for managing customer service lines.
