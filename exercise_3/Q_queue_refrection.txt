Reflection: Why FIFO Ensures Fairness at Ceremonies
Order respected

  - In a graduation, guests arrive in sequence.
  - With a queue (FIFO), the first guest to arrive is the first seated.
  - This respects the time and effort of those who came early.

Equal treatment

   - FIFO prevents late arrivals from jumping ahead of those who waited.
   - Everyone is served fairly in arrival order, creating a sense of justice.

Social harmony

   - At important ceremonies like graduations, fairness reduces conflicts, complaints, and disorder.
   - Guests know the rules are transparent: whoever comes first will be served first.

Contrast with Stack

   - If seating used a stack (LIFO), the last guest to arrive would sit first.
   - This breaks fairness and could cause frustration, as latecomers get an advantage.
